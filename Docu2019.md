Data:
 2019AllData:  Flow rate, 4x DRA readback, 4x On/Off Pumps, 2x VFD Currents, 3x Density
 2019AllData_DRASmoothed: Above, but with smoothed densities

 2019_set1: 2019 data with higher average flow rate - smoothed densities
 2019_set2: 2019 data with lower average flow rate - smoothed densities

Findings:
 - The flow rate is bi-modal, so there could be two operating strategies.
 - We are doing RTO.  IPOPT can estimate finite difference using only input/output data
